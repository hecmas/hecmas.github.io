        I am currently working as a Research Engineer at [ZisK](https://zisk.technology/), specializing in zero-knowledge cryptography and blockchain scalability. Previously, I worked at [Polygon zkEVM](https://github.com/0xPolygonHermez), where I contributed to developing robust arithmetization using the extended Algebraic Intermediate Representation (eAIR) and ensured the integrity of the proving system, a composition of inner [eSTARK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/474.pdf) with outer [fflonK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1167).

        Simultaneously, I am pursuing a Ph.D. in the [Department of Network Engineering](https://entel.upc.edu/en) at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC). My academic journey includes a MSc in [Advanced Mathematics and Mathematical Engineering](https://mamme.masters.upc.edu/en/) from the UPC and a BSc in [Mathematics](https://web.ua.es/en/grados/grado-en-matematicas/undergraduate-degree-in-mathematics.html) from the University of Alicante, with a focus on discrete mathematics. My research ranges from theoretical and applied cryptography to probabilistic proofs, with a special interest in the applicability of zero-knowledge proofs to improve the scalability of blockchains and authentication systems.

        In my free time, I enjoy doing cryptography-based [CTF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) challenges on sites like [CryptoHack](https://cryptohack.org/), [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) or [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/). There is a big difference between theory-oriented (a.k.a., textbook) cryptography and real-world cryptography, so I feel like these challenges make me understand the link between these two worlds.
