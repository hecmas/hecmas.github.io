<!-- **TODO**: Explain why these books are in this list in detail. -->

> [!NOTE]
> I will use the following colors to show my progress with the books:
> - :large_blue_circle: Blue means that I have read the book.
> - :red_circle: Red means that I am in progress. 
> - :black_circle: Black means that I have not started yet but I am willing to.

<!-- > [!NOTE]
> I will also use the following emojis to describe who the books are intended for:
> - :computer: Computer means that the book is focused to developers.
> - :nerd_face: Nerd means that the book is focused to mathematicians/theoretics.
>     - I will use both emojis when a background in mathematics and computer science is totally usefull to really enjoy the books.
> 
> - :couple: Couple means that the books are introductorial books and therefore do not need huge background,
