abstract: "In 2019, Gabizon, Williamson, and Ciobotaru introduced PlonK – a fast and flexible ZK-SNARK with an updatable and universal structured reference string. PlonK uses a grand product argument to check permutations of wire values. The following year, Gabizon and Williamson developed plookup for lookup table verification. We present PlonKup, a fully succinct ZK-SNARK that integrates plookup into PlonK efficiently."
