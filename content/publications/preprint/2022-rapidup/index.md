abstract: "SNARKs for standard cryptographic primitives often include SNARK-unfriendly operations like XOR. Previous protocols like Plookup introduced lookup arguments but were limited to the same circuit. RapidUp solves this by unfolding the grand-product polynomial into two equivalent polynomials, with selector-based generalization."
