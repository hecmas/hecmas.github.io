Conclusion Notation We will denote by $\\mathbb{F}$ to a finite field and $\\mathbb{F}^*$ to its respective multiplicative group. We will also denote as $H$ to a subgroup of $\\mathbb{F}^*$. Finally, we will denote by $Z_H$ to the polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}$ that vanishes on $H$a and call it the vanishing polynomial.\nGiven a polynomial $p \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and an evaluation domain $H$, we will denote by $\\tilde{p}$ to the polynomial resulting from the interpolation of the set of points ${(h, p(h)), \\text{ for } h \\in H}$.\nStatement Let $d,D \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $D \u0026gt; d$ and let $f \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$. Let $g \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ be the polynomial defined as: $$ g(X) = f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nThen, if $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ then we have that $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$ (Prove it! Hint: Divide $f$ by $Z_H$).\nIn our context, it is always the case that $D$ is a power of two and $d$ is not. What we intend with this ‚Äúdegree adjustment‚Äù is to form a polynomial lower than a power of two from a polynomial for which this is not the case.\nOne can imagine $D = 8$ and $d = 5$ so that we adjust the degree to the ‚Äúnext‚Äù power of two.\nTo achieve the converse, we need to involve random coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and define $g(X)$ in the following way: $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nNow, we can claim that $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ if and only if $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$.\nExample: Randomness is Necessary Let‚Äôs see why the converse is not true in the first definition of $g$.\nLet $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{Z}_{97}$ (notably, $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$), let $\\omega = 8$ be a primitive $16$-th root of unity and let: $$ H = \\langle \\omega \\rangle = \\{ 1,8, 64, 27, 22, 79, 50, 12, 96, 89, 33, 70, 75, 18, 47, 85 \\} $$ be the subset of $\\mathbb{F}^*$, generated by $\\omega$, containing all the $16$-th roots of unity. We therefore have that $Z_H(X) = X^{16} - 1$ is the vanishing polynomial on $H$.\nAssume that $D = 8$ and $d = 5$.\nNow, let $f(X) = Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$. We therefore have that: $$ f(X) \\equiv X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5 \\pmod{Z_H(X)}, $$ so that $f(X)$ behaves identical to $X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{f}$ will be of degree $14$.\nIn this case, we have that: \\begin{align} g(X) = \u0026amp;~(Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\\u0026amp; + X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) = \\\\\u0026amp;(X^3 + 1)Z_H(X) + X^{17} - X^{5} = \\\\ \u0026amp;~(X^3 + X + 1)Z_H(X) - X^{5} + X, \\end{align} so that $g$ behaves identical to $-X^{5} + X$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree $5$.\nHence, $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree $5 \u0026lt; D$ even that $\\tilde{f}$ is of degree $14 \u0026gt; d$.\nRandomness comes to the rescue!\nSay that $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 13$.\nIn this case we have: \\begin{align} g(X) = \u0026amp;~3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\\u0026amp;+ 13 \\cdot X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\ \u0026amp;= (13 \\cdot X^3 + 13 \\cdot X + 3)Z_H(X) \\\\\u0026amp;- 10 \\cdot X^{14} + 10 \\cdot X^{11} - 10 \\cdot X^{8} - 3 \\cdot X^5 + 13 \\cdot X, \\end{align} As it can be seen, thanks to the random values, now the high-degree terms do not cancel out and we find that $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree ${14}$.\nAlternatives The following alternatives also work! We should assume however that the Prover cannot predict the randomness in advance.\n$\\beta = \\alpha^2$ (or in general $\\beta = f(\\alpha)$) $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\alpha^2 \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ As far as $\\alpha \\neq \\alpha^2$ this alternative will also work and therefore we would save one random value in the process. However, notice that the probability of $\\tilde{g}$ being a low degree polynomial is of $1 - 2/|\\mathbb{F}|$, since both $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\alpha = 1$ would make it fail.\nIn general, all $\\alpha$‚Äôs that make $\\alpha = \\beta = f(\\alpha)$ would make it fail.\nOnly $\\alpha$ is used $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nOnly $\\beta$ is used $$ g(X) = f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\beta \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nWhen Both Random Values are Needed? Say that we have $f_1,f_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and we define: $$ g(X) = (\\alpha_1 \\cdot f_1(X) + \\beta_1 \\cdot X^{D-d_1} \\cdot f_1(X)) + (\\alpha_2 \\cdot f_2(X) + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^{D-d_2} \\cdot f_2(X)). $$ Here we have that $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree lower than $D$ if and only if the degree of $\\tilde{f_1} \u0026lt; d_1$ and the degree of $\\tilde{f_2} \u0026lt; d_2$.\nWhen we include in the definition of $g$ more than one $f$ polynomial, then both randomness ‚Ä¶","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"3046de1355f11a0fcdb5919f87fdaf95","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/post/snark-degree/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/snark-degree/","section":"post","summary":"On adjusting the degree of SNARK-related polynomials to fit our needs","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Degree Adjustment in SNARKs","type":"post"},{"authors":["H√©ctor Masip Ardevol","Jordi Baylina Mel√©","Daniel Lubarov","Jose Luis Mu√±oz Tapia"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660348800,"objectID":"7e98dbfe5d39d775fc16fe711891fc12","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","publishdate":"2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","section":"publication","summary":"SNARKs for some standard cryptographic primitives tend to be plenty designed with SNARK-unfriendly operations such as XOR.
