Fflonk is a variant of PlonK that offers significantly improved verifier performance, albeit at the cost of roughly tripling the prover time. Fflonk achieves this through the use of a variant of the KZG polynomial commitment scheme that reduces the opening of multiple polynomials at a single point to the opening of a single polynomial at multiple points via an \"FFT-like\" construction.\nHowever, the increased prover time of Fflonk is not a significant concern in the context of the zkEVM, as the size of the circuit that Fflonk is being applied to is relatively small thanks to a series of reductions via proof composition of a STARK-based proving system (our eSTARK). Furthermore, we have made slight modifications to Fflonk to ensure a faster prover and gave the option of turning it zero-knowledge in a PlonK-style manner.","tags":[],"title":"Fflonk for the Polygon zkEVM","type":"event"},{"authors":["Héctor Masip Ardevol","Marc Guzmán Albiol","Jordi Baylina Melé","Jose Luis Muñoz Tapia"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1680393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1680393600,"objectID":"5e462b693ac9ffcfc1fd0506ae42aa43","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/publication/preprint/2023/estark/","publishdate":"2023-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/2023/estark/","section":"publication","summary":"STARK is a widely used transparent proof system that uses low-degree tests for proving the correctness of a computer program. STARK consumes an intermediate representation known as AIR that is more appropriate for programs with a relatively short and structured description. However, an AIR is not able to succinctly express non-equality constraints, leading to the incorporation of unwanted polynomials. We present the eSTARK protocol, a new probabilistic proof that generalizes the STARK family through the introduction of a more generic intermediate representa- tion called eAIR. We describe eSTARK in the polynomial IOP model, which com- bines the optimized version of the STARK protocol with the incorporation of three arguments into the protocol. We also explain various techniques that enhance the vanilla STARK complexity, including optimizations applied to polynomial computa- tions, and analyze the tradeoffs between controlling the constraint degree either at the representation of the AIR or inside the eSTARK itself.","tags":null,"title":"eSTARK: Extending STARKs with Arguments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Héctor Masip Ardevol"],"categories":["Blockchain","Cryptography"],"content":" Table of Contents Mathematical Background Cryptography Pure Cryptography Applications Elliptic Curve Cryptography Zero-Knowledge Proofs Blockchain Theory Solidity Computer Science Probability Recreational I will use the following colors to show my progress with the books:\n🔵 Blue means that I have read the book. 🔴 Red means that I am in progress. ⚫ Black means that I have not started yet but I am willing to.

Conclusion Notation We will denote by $\\mathbb{F}$ to a finite field and $\\mathbb{F}^*$ to its respective multiplicative group. We will also denote as $H$ to a subgroup of $\\mathbb{F}^*$. Finally, we will denote by $Z_H$ to the polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}$ that vanishes on $H$a and call it the vanishing polynomial.\nGiven a polynomial $p \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and an evaluation domain $H$, we will denote by $\\tilde{p}$ to the polynomial resulting from the interpolation of the set of points ${(h, p(h)), \\text{ for } h \\in H}$.\nStatement Let $d,D \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $D \u0026gt; d$ and let $f \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$. Let $g \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ be the polynomial defined as: $$ g(X) = f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nThen, if $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ then we have that $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$ (Prove it! Hint: Divide $f$ by $Z_H$).\nIn our context, it is always the case that $D$ is a power of two and $d$ is not. What we intend with this “degree adjustment” is to form a polynomial lower than a power of two from a polynomial for which this is not the case.\nOne can imagine $D = 8$ and $d = 5$ so that we adjust the degree to the “next” power of two.\nTo achieve the converse, we need to involve random coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and define $g(X)$ in the following way: $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nNow, we can claim that $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ if and only if $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$.\nExample: Randomness is Necessary Let’s see why the converse is not true in the first definition of $g$.\nLet $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{Z}_{97}$ (notably, $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$), let $\\omega = 8$ be a primitive $16$-th root of unity and let: $$ H = \\langle \\omega \\rangle = \\{ 1,8, 64, 27, 22, 79, 50, 12, 96, 89, 33, 70, 75, 18, 47, 85 \\} $$ be the subset of $\\mathbb{F}^*$, generated by $\\omega$, containing all the $16$-th roots of unity. We therefore have that $Z_H(X) = X^{16} - 1$ is the vanishing polynomial on $H$.\nAssume that $D = 8$ and $d = 5$.\nNow, let $f(X) = Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$. We therefore have that: $$ f(X) \\equiv X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5 \\pmod{Z_H(X)}, $$ so that $f(X)$ behaves identical to $X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{f}$ will be of degree $14$.\nIn this case, we have that: \\begin{align} g(X) = \u0026amp;~(Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\\u0026amp; + X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) = \\\\\u0026amp;(X^3 + 1)Z_H(X) + X^{17} - X^{5} = \\\\ \u0026amp;~(X^3 + X + 1)Z_H(X) - X^{5} + X, \\end{align} so that $g$ behaves identical to $-X^{5} + X$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree $5$.\nHence, $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree $5 \u0026lt; D$ even that $\\tilde{f}$ is of degree $14 \u0026gt; d$.\nRandomness comes to the rescue!\nSay that $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 13$.\nIn this case we have: \\begin{align} g(X) = \u0026amp;~3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\\u0026amp;+ 13 \\cdot X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\\\ \u0026amp;= (13 \\cdot X^3 + 13 \\cdot X + 3)Z_H(X) \\\\\u0026amp;- 10 \\cdot X^{14} + 10 \\cdot X^{11} - 10 \\cdot X^{8} - 3 \\cdot X^5 + 13 \\cdot X, \\end{align} As it can be seen, thanks to the random values, now the high-degree terms do not cancel out and we find that $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree ${14}$.\nAlternatives The following alternatives also work! We should assume however that the Prover cannot predict the randomness in advance.\n$\\beta = \\alpha^2$ (or in general $\\beta = f(\\alpha)$) $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\alpha^2 \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ As far as $\\alpha \\neq \\alpha^2$ this alternative will also work and therefore we would save one random value in the process. However, notice that the probability of $\\tilde{g}$ being a low degree polynomial is of $1 - 2/|\\mathbb{F}|$, since both $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\alpha = 1$ would make it fail.\nIn general, all $\\alpha$’s that make $\\alpha = \\beta = f(\\alpha)$ would make it fail.\nOnly $\\alpha$ is used $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nOnly $\\beta$ is used $$ g(X) = f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\beta \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nWhen Both Random Values are Needed? Say that we have $f_1,f_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and we define: $$ g(X) = (\\alpha_1 \\cdot f_1(X) + \\beta_1 \\cdot X^{D-d_1} \\cdot f_1(X)) + (\\alpha_2 \\cdot f_2(X) + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^{D-d_2} \\cdot f_2(X)). $$ Here we have that $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree lower than $D$ if and only if the degree of $\\tilde{f_1} \u0026lt; d_1$ and the degree of $\\tilde{f_2} \u0026lt; d_2$.\nWhen we include in the definition of $g$ more than one $f$ polynomial, then both randomness …","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665705600,"objectID":"3046de1355f11a0fcdb5919f87fdaf95","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/post/snark-degree/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/snark-degree/","section":"post","summary":"On adjusting the degree of SNARK-related polynomials to fit our needs","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Degree Adjustment in SNARKs","type":"post"},{"authors":["Héctor Masip Ardevol","Jordi Baylina Melé","Daniel Lubarov","Jose Luis Muñoz Tapia"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660348800,"objectID":"7e98dbfe5d39d775fc16fe711891fc12","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","publishdate":"2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","section":"publication","summary":"SNARKs for some standard cryptographic primitives tend to be plenty designed with SNARK-unfriendly operations such as XOR.
