We will also denote as $H$ to a subgroup of $\\mathbb{F}^*$. Finally, we will denote by $Z_H$ to the polynomial over $\\mathbb{F}$ that vanishes on $H$a and call it the vanishing polynomial.\nGiven a polynomial $p \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and an evaluation domain $H$, we will denote by $\\tilde{p}$ to the polynomial resulting from the interpolation of the set of points ${(h, p(h)), \\text{ for } h \\in H}$.\nStatement Let $d,D \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $D \u0026gt; d$ and let $f \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$. Let $g \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ be the polynomial defined as: $$ g(X) = f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nThen, if $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ then we have that $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$ (Prove it! Hint: Divide $f$ by $Z_H$).\nIn our context, it is always the case that $D$ is a power of two and $d$ is not. What we intend with this “degree adjustment” is to form a polynomial lower than a power of two from a polynomial for which this is not the case.\nOne can imagine $D = 8$ and $d = 5$ so that we adjust the degree to the “next” power of two.\nTo achieve the converse, we need to involve random coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ and define $g(X)$ in the following way: $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$\nNow, we can claim that $\\tilde{f}$ has degree lower than $d$ if and only if $\\tilde{g}$ has degree lower than $D$.\nExample: Randomness is Necessary Let’s see why the converse is not true in the first definition of $g$.\nLet $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{Z}_{97}$ (notably, $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$), let $\\omega = 8$ be a primitive $16$-th root of unity and let: $$ H = \\langle \\omega \\rangle = {1,8, 64, 27, 22, 79, 50, 12, 96, 89, 33, 70, 75, 18, 47, 85} $$ be the subset of $\\mathbb{F}^*$, generated by $\\omega$, containing all the $16$-th roots of unity. We therefore have that $Z_H(X) = X^{16} - 1$ is the vanishing polynomial on $H$.\nAssume that $D = 8$ and $d = 5$.\nNow, let $f(X) = Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$. We therefore have that: $$ f(X) \\equiv X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5 \\pmod{Z_H(X)}, $$ so that $f(X)$ behaves identical to $X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{f}$ will be of degree $14$.\nIn this case, we have that: \\begin{align} g(X) \u0026amp;= (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) + X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\ \u0026amp;= (X^3 + 1)Z_H(X) + X^{17} - X^{5} = (X^3 + X + 1)Z_H(X) - X^{5} + X, \\end{align} so that $g$ behaves identical to $-X^{5} + X$ when evaluated on $H$, implying that the interpolated polynomial $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree $5$.\nHence, $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree $5 \u0026lt; D$ even that $\\tilde{f}$ is of degree $14 \u0026gt; d$.\nRandomness comes to the rescue!\nSay that $\\alpha = 3$ and $\\beta = 13$.\nIn this case we have: \\begin{align} g(X) \u0026amp;= 3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) + 13 \\cdot X^3 \\cdot (Z_H(X) + X^{14} - X^{11} + X^{8} - X^5) \\ \u0026amp;= (13 \\cdot X^3 + 13 \\cdot X + 3)Z_H(X) - 10 \\cdot X^{14} + 10 \\cdot X^{11} - 10 \\cdot X^{8} - 3 \\cdot X^5 + 13 \\cdot X, \\end{align}\nAs it can be seen, thanks to the random values, now the high-degree terms do not cancel out and we find that $\\tilde{g}$ is a polynomial of degree ${14}$.\nAlternatives The following alternatives also work! We should assume however that the Prover cannot predict the randomness in advance.\n$\\beta = \\alpha^2$ (or in general $\\beta = f(\\alpha)$) $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + \\alpha^2 \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ As far as $\\alpha \\neq \\alpha^2$ this alternative will also work and therefore we would save one random value in the process. However, notice that the probability of $\\tilde{g}$ being a low degree polynomial is of $1 - 2/|\\mathbb{F}|$, since both $\\alpha = 0$ and $\\alpha = 1$ would make it fail.\nIn general, all $\\alpha$’s that make $\\alpha = \\beta = f(\\alpha)$ would make it fail.\nOnly $\\alpha$ is used $$ g(X) = \\alpha \\cdot f(X) + X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\alpha \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nOnly $\\beta$ is used $$ g(X) = f(X) + \\beta \\cdot X^{D-d} \\cdot f(X). $$ This should work as far $\\beta \\neq 1$. The probability here is of $1 - 1/|\\mathbb{F}|$.\nWhen Both Random Values are Necessary Say that we have $f_1,f_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ and we define: $$ g(X) = (\\alpha_1 \\cdot f_1(X) + \\beta_1 \\cdot X^{D-d_1} \\cdot f_1(X)) + (\\alpha_2 \\cdot f_2(X) + \\beta_2 \\cdot X^{D-d_2} \\cdot f_2(X)). $$ Here we have that $\\tilde{g}$ is of degree lower than $D$ if and only if the degree of $\\tilde{f_1} \u0026lt; d_1$ and the degree of $\\tilde{f_2} \u0026lt; d_2$.\nWhen we include in the definition of $g$ more than one $f$ polynomial, then both randomness are necessary to achieve the highest probability.\nConclusion We arrive to the following conclusions:\nIf only one $f$ polynomial is included in the definition of $g$, then simply sample a random value $\\alpha$ and define: $$ g(X) = f(X) + \\alpha \\cdot …","date":1665532800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1665532800,"objectID":"b28a26aafc4598c3aa0aa5c10f257a1e","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/post/snarks/","publishdate":"2022-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/snarks/","section":"post","summary":"On adjusting the degree of SNARK-related polynomials to fit our needs.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Degree Adjustment in SNARKs","type":"post"},{"authors":["Héctor Masip Ardevol"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1660348800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1660348800,"objectID":"71c7083d44215ba678711f12b883949a","permalink":"https://hecmas.github.io/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","publishdate":"2022-08-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint/2022/rapidup/","section":"publication","summary":"SNARKs for some standard cryptographic primitives tend to be plenty designed with SNARK-unfriendly operations such as XOR.

PlonK uses a grand product argument to check permutations of wire values, and exploits convenient interactions between   multiplicative subgroups and Lagrange bases. The following year, Gabizon and Williamson used similar techniques to develop plookup – a ZK-SNARK that can verify that each element from a list of queries can be found in a public lookup table. In this paper, we present PlonKup, a fully succinct ZK-SNARK that integrates the ideas from plookup into PlonK in an efficient way.","tags":null,"title":"PlonKup: Reconciling PlonK with plookup","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
